# THE CORTEX CHRONICLES, CHAPTER 1 - The Trial of Rowan Reed

![TitleImage](screenshots/screen01.png)

Developed for the Game Creator's Club at Lusofona University.
This month, the theme was "Ren'py", so of course I used it to make this game.

This is a part of what I hope will be "The Cortex Chronicles" - I want all the games I do for the Game Creator's Club this year to be linked together, hence this idea.
I also want to use a different engine on every entry, so let's see how that goes! :)

The game is a simple Visual Novel, in which we play as Rowan Reed, a librarian in a dystopic future where mankind is controlled by the Prime Nexus, a human-AI hybrid.

Art was done using Midjourney, and then processed in Photoshop to give the high-res ZX-Spectrum look I was looking for.
